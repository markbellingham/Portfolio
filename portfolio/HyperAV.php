<h1>HyperAV</h1>
<div class="left">
  <h4>A dynamic website using PHP and MySQL to demonstrate an online shop</h4>
  <p>
    HyperAV was a group project that was built for the 2nd year Information Systems and Database Development assignment. The aim for the project was to design and build a database with a PHP front end that would be the online presence for a fictional audio visual store, that has multiple store locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    A report for the project was published as a group effort. It contains details of the desicion-making process as well as other useful information such as Use Case Diagrams and Entity Relationship Diagrams.

    <br /><br />
    Since the report was created, I have extensively improved the project - repairing some of the features that were not working, enhancing and adding new features in order to bring about my original vision for the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    <h3>Website features:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>List products, filter by category</li>
      <li>View individual product with extended information and related products</li>
      <li>Register and login system</li>
      <li>Automatically updating shopping basket with indicator</li>
      <li>User can change quantity and delete items in basket</li>
      <li>Customer can view previous orders</li>
      <li>User can change their password</li>
      <li>Admin can insert update and delete items</li>
      <li>Admin can view various reports</li>
    </ul>
