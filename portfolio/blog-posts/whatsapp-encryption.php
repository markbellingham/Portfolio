Amber Rudd is again showing her incompetence by saying that she doesn't need to understand how encryption works in order to argue against it. She complains of the technology companies sneering at her, yet if she would just spend even a single day studying the subject she would realise that what she is asking for is impossible. As a short analogy, installing back doors in encryption because terrorists might use it is like giving the police the keys to your house because criminals also lock their doors. Except those keys are actually kept under your mat where anyone can access them. Back doors in encryption cannot be solely kept for law enforcement agencies. If they are known to exist, they will be searched for and likely found.

Forcing companies such as WhatsApp to install back doors would not stop terrorists because methods of using unbreakable encryption are widely known and freely available. Terrorists and paedophiles could easily move to a different app (there are many) or even create one of their own, it's not particularly difficult and even I as a novice programmer would be able to create something in a matter of days. The people who orchestrated the gun attack in Paris in November 2015 were using plain unencrypted text messages. The Manchester bomber Salman Abedi had previously been reported to the police for his extreme views. It's pretty clear that even when the police do have access to information, they are not always able to react. I would suggest that what they really need is more manpower so that they can engage with communities.

Secure encryption is important for many reasons, not least because it keeps our financial transactions safe. It also provides a means for people who live in countries with oppressive governments to talk freely without fear of intimidation or persecution. Nothing to hide only works when you and the people in power share the values of you and everyone you know entirely, and always will.

For a longer and slightly more technical, but still simple and easy to understand explanation about why back doors in encryption are a bad idea, I would really really like you and other MPs to watch this 11 minute video by Tom Scott.
